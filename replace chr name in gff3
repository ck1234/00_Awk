#replace chr name by matching column old from chr_name.txt to Gal5_genes.gff3, then replace match with column new from chr_name.txt.
#make sure you keep a copy of your original gff file because this code over-writes the file

cat chr_name.txt | while read old new; do sed "s/$old/$new/g" genes.gff3 >tmp.txt; mv tmp.txt Gal5_genes.gff3; done
